# WordPress Cheat Sheet

The aim of this is to provide an essential list of WordPress resources for both end-users and developers.

The obvious place to start for anything Wordpress is the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/). However, what we plan to do here is to provide a curated list both from the Codex and also other resources available on the net. Wherever possible we aim to include free resources but will indicate if we include any subscription sources. Unless indicated, all resources will be in English as that is our native language.

If you would like to contribute, please send us a PR.
